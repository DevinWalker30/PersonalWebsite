                <p>Hi my name is Devin Walker! I'm a 17 year old Junior at Portland High School in downtown Portland Maine. I was born in Portland and split my time between my two parents. I have attended all of my schooling in Portland from Presumpscot Elementary to Lyman Moore and now to Portland High. When I’m not with my Dad I am living in Hallowell Maine with my Mom. Hallowell is a little town just south of Maine’s capital city, Augusta. I’m an avid athlete who loves competition between friends and teammates. I enjoy all types of sports, especially basketball, baseball, football and golf. I like to spend my time either outdoors tinkering with my cars or working in the garage doing woodworking. When I’m not outside, usually because of the cold weather we get in Maine, I am inside either reading, watching tv or playing video games or board games and could be even playing either the piano or guitar. With music being my newest interest I have yet to fully master it but I keep learning new songs to play when I’m bored. I usually get my song inspirations from my favorite artists coming from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, with my favorites being Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, and Billy Joel. I’ve learned a few songs from all of these artists on both guitar and the piano and I am hoping to expand my knowledge and keep learning more of their songs. Though I do like to learn songs from somewhat recent years I also enjoy songs like, Moonlight Sonata, and Clare de Lune, which have been my favorites to learn on the piano.</p>

                    <p>Music has always been a pashon of mine as in my younger years I experimented with a couple instruments. Nowadays I mainly stick to two, those being the guitar and the piano, though I have a few bass' in my room and I occasionally pick one up and play.</p>

I also play travel basketball with the organization Black Bear North, stationed here in Portland with games and tournaments all across New England.</p>
