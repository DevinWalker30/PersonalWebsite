                    I would like to consider myself as an amiture woodworker and hopefully a good one at that. I was tasked to build tops for my mom and my mom's friend's dog crates as we both got sister puppies at the same time. I waS tasked with making three different toppers, one for us two for the friend. They were all different sizes so I had to get three pieces of flat plywood and some quarter rounds. I used a table saw to cut down on the plywood and used a chop saw for the quarter round. This project took me a few days to complete in total as I had to do all of the measuring, cutting, nailing, and staining by myself, along with my school work and basketball. Dispite all of this thhough I managed to get done with all three and they are all in use with no complaints.

                        Another one of my woodworking projects is this shef that I am halfway done with. I built it out of some scrap 2-4s that were left out and some leftover ceiling pieces from a new wing we recently added to our house. I decided to make this because I need a shelf to hold my shoes due to my dog frequently grabbing them and bringing them around the house with her. I decided to make two seperate levels (not shown in the image as it's still a work in progress) so I can hold things on the top such as plants and candles and what not. I'm really excited about this project because it will be my first free standing build as my other projects have all either been wall mounted shelves or hooks or toppers for the dog crates. I'm hoping to be done with this project in the very near future.

                        My next project is not a tangible one as it is a <a href="https://devinwalker30.github.io/WebDevelopment/" target="_blank" style="color: #B2AA8E;">Website</a> which I have developed and is open to the public. I did this my Junior year in my Web Development course and it is one of my most favorite projects I have made in all of my coding courses. It is a combination of all of my assignments and projects over the year, with my favorite and most recent being the weather widgit that can access your location and get the weather updates in your area. You can see how I've grown as a website developer and has all of my projects from my first attempt to my most recent projects, with everything in between.

                        Again I'll be talking about a non-physical project that I did but still one that I am proud of. This is my English <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfn2D0muQ4h93jCTwQKADkeHvUfvxqY3f_a0pZIOics/edit" target="_blank" style="color: #B2AA8E;">Paper</a> that I wrote for my AP Lang and Comp class about the death penalty after reading Sister Helen Prejean's novel Dead Man Walking. I'm happy with this paper as it was one of the harder ones written in that class as we had to read the entire novel first and then do a research paper on the topic, which took many weeks. Dispite this though I think this paper really enmulates my writing style and how I respond to hard English papers.
