                My first volunteering experience was the summer between Freshman and Sophmore year where I was helping a man in my neighborhood as he was recovering from a recent foot sergery. I spent a few hours a week there with him and would help him around the house, whether that be moving his bedroom downstairs for easier access or watering his outdoor plants for him. I spent the majority of my time there just helping out around the house and trying to help him in any way I could. I spent maybe 16 to 20 hours over that summer helping him out as he was rehabing from his surgery. I actually had to employ my knowledge of cars and helped him unlock his car as his key fob had run out of battery. I had to take the fob apart and find the key in it and then find the keyhole underneath the doorhandle to unlock it. I also would wash his car when it was getting dirty from the birds that would land on it and the telephone wires connected to his house. All in all it was a great experience and I had fun helping out someone in the community who I hadn't really met fully.

                    My second volunteering job has yet to happen though it will take place this summer between my Junior and Senior year. I have signed up for the Hallowell Conservation Society which is a group that helps keep my city clean and the surrounding areas clean as well. The gist of what I will be doing is monitoring the Vaughn Brook in Vaughn Woods in Hallowell. I will be monitoring the heath of this stream in our little forest and making sure it is healthy. It comprises of me waking up fairly early on days where I have signed up and one of the heads of the project come with me as we test different sites on the stream and check it's health. They also work somewhat closely with the Department of Environmetal Protection, which is a group that is very familiar with me as both my Mom and Stepdad worked for the DEP for some time, I also have a bunch of DEP branded clothing that I am looking forward to repping. I'm super excited about this project as this is very similar to what my mom did as a summer job her Freshman into her Sophmore year of college. She was a part of a group where they would go to different sites along a few different rivers and tag salmon that swim upstream and track their location.
