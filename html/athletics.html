                    I love baseball though I haven't played in a while as I have been more focused on basketball during the spring because that is when travel basketball is at it's height. When I was younger I always thought of myself as becoming a major league baseball player and I had my mind set on that, though that has slipped away from me since entering high school. Being a baseball player has been in my core since a young age and I can remember playing catch with my dad in the street until you couldn't differentiate the ball coming at you from a random shadow in the night as we stayed out so late. I was very dedicated as I played fall ball in middle school and even used to get my mom to drive me to an automatic pitching batting cage in Chelsea, right across the river from where we live in Hallowell. I also used to bike down to the park with my dad on sunny hot days in the summer where we would go to the farm league field for hitting and fielding practice. Those were some of the most fun days in my life and I will forever be a baseball player, as I took a part in baseball my freshman year and had a great year.

                    I'm a total basketball junkie and have loved basketball ever since I can remember. It's my main sport and I have put more hours into basketball than anything else I can think of, other than school. I've spent countless hours out in my driveway perfecting my shot from the corners as thats the only place I can shoot from unless I shoot from our garden next to my house. I got my hoop back in fourth grade and probably have more than ten thousand hours using it. I also play travel ball where in recent years we have traveled all across New England and partake in many multi-state wide tournaments. I usually don't have much more than a few weeks off from basketball before I start my next season. From the school season to travel then to school summer ball and then back to travel before the school season starts again, I barley get much of a break but I love every second! I hope to pursue higher levels of basketball as I get older and perhaps in college. I'm hoping that with basketball I can propell myself into much higher education and better courses. Basketball is a way for me to escape and is a therapy session for me as I can relax and ease my mind, most likely why I play it so much. Long story shot, I love basketball and there isn't a second that goes by where I don't want to be out there playing.

                    Golf is probably one of the most fun sports I play just because I get so excited to play. Living in Maine we have a small golf window and I have to utalize it every chance I get. I think of it as an 'investment sport' since I won't be able to play basketball and baseball forever. I love golfing and it was a great way to stay conneted with my stepfather who was a big golfer himself. I find it to be the most amusing as I'm out there with friends laughing and joking along the way, and I love every second of it. I have this tradition where every year on the last day of school my friend who goes to a different school, and another one of my friends as well as myself go golfing and play nine holes for fun. This has become one of my favorite traditions as it gives me an excuse to go out and golf with my buddies as soon as I have the free time and the absence of responsability. I usually try to get out and golf a few weeks a month in the summer and I don't think my love for golf is going anywhere soon.
