                    I'm a new admittee of the National Honors Society, as I was inducted in late April of 2024 and will keep up that status though senior year. I am also a recipient of the RIT Economics Leader book award in 2024. Also I was the recipient of the unofficial award of having the highest final grade in my freshman advanced math program at the end of the year, out scoring all in my class.

                    I have taken a few strenious courses during my time at PHS including finishing AP Calculus AB with a final grade of 94%, along with taking AP US History my Sophmore and Junior years and finishing that course with a 93%, and the final AP course I have completed so far is AP English and Composition, finishing with a 95%. Other courses I have taken thus far into high school are honors level chemistry, honors level french all three years, honors python coding my Freshman year and honors data analysis coding in Google Collab my Sophmore year. Other than that I have taken advanced math courses both my Freshman and Sophmore year, those being AMP I and AMP II respectivly.

                    There are many courses and areas of study that I would love to persue in high school, and especially after that. I'm enrolled in AP Literature and Composition and will be taking that course next year as I have some experience with AP classes since taking AP Language. I also am interested in Literature and am an avid reader, so a class based on reading perfectly alignes with what I value. I also will be continuing my Calculus venture my Senior year as I am also enrolled in AP Calculus BC and will be continuing to learn and embrace the math that seems so foreign to me now. Finally, I will be taking AP Physics next year as I am vastly interested with physics and how our world works, which leads me to talk about what I want post high school. In college I am interested in STEM and believe engineering would fit me best as I have always had a math oriented brain and have been working with real world constructing since I was little as I am a somewhat skilled woodworker. I also enjoy learning about space and fusion and black holes. It facinates me to learn about what is all around us that we are so unaware of and how many of these things affect our lives everyday and we still don't know how they work. I would want to learn how they work and to discover new ways our universe is built. With these two courses in mind, as well as a minor in computer science as I have had a passion for computers since I was young as well, I believe I could go into Aerospace Engineering and combine my love of real world math and building and space and space exploration.
